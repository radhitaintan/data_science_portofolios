## Projects

### Simple Dental Clinic Management System
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/radhitaintan/dtids_purwadhika_capstone_1)
- March - April 2024
- Designed and implemented a CRUD application for a dental clinic system.
- Conducted rigorous testing to ensure reliability and performance.
- Collaborated with a small team to refine user requirements.

### Business Analysis in Transjakarta Transportation
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/radhitaintan/dtids_purwadhika_capstone_2)| [Dashboard Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/radhita.intan.anggraini/viz/DashboardTransjakarta_Capstone2/RevenueProfitableRute)
- May - June 2024
- Analyzes Transjakarta's tap-in and tap-out daily revenue and identifies the most profitable routes.
- The goal is to provide actionable insights that can enhance route efficiency, improve passenger satisfaction, and maximize revenue.
- Presented findings to senior management for decision-making.

### Predicting Claim Travel Insurance
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/radhitaintan/dtids_purwadhika_capstone3_4)
Create a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will make an insurance claim based on their travel and demographic data.
- Maximize Recall: Focus on maximizing recall to minimize the number of false negatives, ensuring that most claims are correctly identified.
- Handle Class Imbalance: Implement techniques such as SMOTE to deal with class imbalance, ensuring the model is effective in identifying the minority class (claims).
- Feature Selection: Identify and select the most relevant features that contribute to predicting insurance claims to enhance model performance.
- Threshold Optimization: Adjust the decision threshold to further improve recall, ensuring that the model is sensitive enough to catch most claims.
